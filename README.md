# ![waves](wave.png)Forcasting Significant Wave Height using ML models (LSTM-CNN) ![waves](wave.png)
Prediction of significant wave height is crucial for several coastal engineering applications. 
You will find in this repo an example of jupyter notebooks for Ocean Waves forcasting using data from buoy station.

The model are divided into two part:

## Short term prediction :
  1. ([modeling using LSTM and CNN](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/oulebsir-rafik/Wave_modelling/blob/master/HS%20notebook/HS%20modeling%20using%20LSTM%20and%20CNN.ipynb)) : Code example of short-term modeling with LSTM and CNN, using Keras for the neural network part and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for the visualization part. ***the charts do not appear in the nbviewer you'll need to download or clone the notebook***
